    <string name="welcome_insn_1">This is a *joke*, *the* certain military aircraft radio-like Twitter client.</string>
    <string name="welcome_insn_2">It shows your timeline and events (favorite/RT/listed/unlisted etc.) on realtime, in relatively unobtrusive HUD-like manner.  You can use this for quickly (or idly) catching up or just watching what\'s going on your world.</string>
    <string name="welcome_insn_3">* You cannot do tweet/RT/favor/etc. with itself.  Please use another client for that matter.</string>
    <string name="welcome_insn_4">USAGE</string>
    <string name="welcome_insn_5">1. Press "start", authenticate with Twitter, and watch.</string>
    <string name="welcome_insn_6">2. Call the app and tap the "stop" button to quit.</string>
